This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up API Keys

This app requires several API keys:

#### Finnhub API Key (Required)
For real-time stock data via WebSocket.

1. Visit [https://finnhub.io/register](https://finnhub.io/register) and create a free account
2. Copy your API key from the dashboard
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
4. Add the environment variables:
   ```
   FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
   ```

#### OpenAI API Key (Required)
For the AI trading assistant.

1. Get your API key from [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

#### Linkup API Key (Optional)
For web search capabilities in the AI assistant.

1. Get your API key from [https://www.linkup.so/](https://www.linkup.so/)
2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   LINKUP_API_KEY=your_linkup_api_key_here
   ```
   
**Note:** The app uses WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming instead of polling, which is more efficient and recommended by Finnhub. You control when to start/stop streaming with the toggle button in the UI. When you switch symbols, the WebSocket automatically unsubscribes from the old symbol and subscribes to the new one without disconnecting.

### 2. Run the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
